BATCH PROCESSING PLAN - ADAPTED TO EXISTING IMPLEMENTATION

1. LEVERAGE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE
    - Use existing data connections/APIs
    - Adapt current ticker loading mechanism
    - Maintain existing data structures
    - Keep current error handling patterns

2. MINIMAL CHANGES APPROACH
    For each batch:
    
    a) DATA COLLECTION (Enhanced)
        - Wrap existing data fetching in batch loop
        - Add batch size configuration (start with current capacity)
        - Keep existing API rate limiting
        - Maintain current retry logic
    
    b) PROCESSING (Existing + Staging)
        - Use current analysis pipeline
        - Add temporary result storage step
        - Keep existing filtering/screening
        - Maintain current output format
    
    c) PROGRESS TRACKING (New)
        - Simple file-based checkpoints
        - Log batch completion status
        - Track processed ticker count
    
    d) MEMORY MANAGEMENT (Enhanced)
        - Clear batch data after processing
        - Monitor memory usage
        - Implement data chunking if needed

3. GRADUAL ROLLOUT
    - Test with small batches first
    - Monitor performance impact
    - Scale batch size based on results
    - Keep fallback to current process

ADAPTATION POINTS:
- Batch size = Current system's comfortable limit
- Use existing database/storage
- Wrap current functions with batch logic
- Add progress tracking to current workflow

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - STEP BY STEP EXECUTION

PHASE 1: PREPARATION (1-2 days)
    1.1 Create backup of current system
    1.2 Identify batch size limit (test with 10-50 tickers)
    1.3 Create batch configuration file:
        - batch_size: [determined limit]
        - checkpoint_file: "batch_progress.json"
        - temp_results_dir: "batch_temp/"
    1.4 Set up progress tracking structure

PHASE 2: CORE MODIFICATIONS (2-3 days)
    2.1 Wrap ticker loading with batch iterator:
        - Split full ticker list into chunks
        - Create batch counter/indexer
    2.2 Add checkpoint system:
        - Save progress after each batch
        - Enable resume from last checkpoint
    2.3 Implement temporary result storage:
        - Save batch results to temp files
        - Merge results at end of processing
    2.4 Add memory cleanup after each batch

PHASE 3: INTEGRATION (1-2 days)
    3.1 Modify main processing loop:
        - Add batch wrapper around existing pipeline
        - Insert progress logging
        - Add memory monitoring
    3.2 Update error handling:
        - Batch-level error recovery
        - Continue processing on batch failure
    3.3 Create result consolidation step

PHASE 4: TESTING & DEPLOYMENT (2-3 days)
    4.1 Test with 3 small batches (10 tickers each)
    4.2 Test checkpoint/resume functionality
    4.3 Monitor memory usage and performance
    4.4 Scale test with larger batches
    4.5 Full deployment with monitoring

ROLLBACK PLAN:
    - Keep original code intact
    - Use feature flag to switch between batch/single mode
    - Maintain ability to revert instantly
